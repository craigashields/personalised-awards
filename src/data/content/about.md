Our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea that took root in the hearts of two ambitious individuals from Warrington. We were driven by a desire to inject a dose of excitement and innovation into the somewhat stagnant awards market. Personalised Awards was conceived amidst the challenges and reflections brought on by the lockdown, a period that, despite its hardships, sparked creativity and determination in us.

By the end of 2021, our vision had materialized into our first major product line â€“ the acrylic range. This wasn't just another addition to the market; it was a statement of our commitment to excellence and innovation. Our awards are designed not just to acknowledge achievements but to celebrate the individuality and effort behind each success. They are colourful, customizable, and, most importantly, affordable, ensuring that recognition is accessible to all.

At Personalised Awards, we believe that recognition should leave a lasting impression. Our awards are crafted to be cherished, a tangible reminder of achievement that teams and individuals will appreciate and value for years to come. This belief is at the core of everything we do, pushing us to constantly innovate and improve.

We invite you to get in touch with our dedicated team today. Discover how Personalised Awards can transform your awards night, making it not just an event, but a memorable experience that celebrates success in a manner as unique as the achievements themselves. Let us help you make your recognition truly special.
